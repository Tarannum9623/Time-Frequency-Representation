# Time-Frequency Analysis of Audio Signals

This repository contains code and resources for performing time-frequency analysis of audio signals. Time-frequency analysis is a fundamental technique in signal processing used to analyze signals that vary in frequency over time. This approach is particularly useful for understanding non-stationary signals, where the frequency content changes dynamically.

## Overview

In this project, we demonstrate the process of time-frequency analysis applied to audio signals. We follow a step-by-step approach to extract audio files, process them, perform Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and generate spectrograms. Additionally, we analyze a chirp signal and its spectrogram to illustrate the concepts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Librosa, Sounddevice

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
